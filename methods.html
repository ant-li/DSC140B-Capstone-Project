            <h2>Transformers vs CNN architectures</h2>
            <p>Understanding the differences between Transformers and CNN architectures is crucial for developing
                effective emotion recognition models. While CNNs are traditionally favored for image-related tasks,
                Transformers have recently made significant inroads, offering promising results thanks to their
                attention mechanisms. We explore both architectures to evaluate their performance in the context of our
                project.</p>

            <h2>Transfer Learning</h2>
            <p>Transfer learning is a powerful technique in machine learning, especially when dealing with limited
                datasets. By leveraging the knowledge gained from pre-trained models, we can significantly improve the
                performance of our emotion recognition system. This section outlines our approach to transfer learning,
                including the models and datasets we used.</p>

            <h2>Pretrained / Full Layer Training</h2>
            <p>The decision between using a fully pretrained model or further training the entire model layers depends
                on the specific requirements of the task at hand. We discuss the pros and cons of each method, our
                experimental setup, and the outcomes of our approach.</p>

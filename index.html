    <h1>Unveiling Emotions: Bridging the Gap in Children's Emotional Recognition</h1>
    <p class="tagline">Capturing the essence of emotion in every child's face.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>What is the Problem?</h2>
    <p>In the evolving field of emotional recognition, a significant gap hampers our understanding and technology: the
        nuanced emotions of children. Traditional models, while effective to an extent with adults, stumble when faced
        with the delicate and diverse expressions of children. These models miss the mark, trained primarily on adult
        faces, failing to capture the subtleties unique to childrenâ€™s emotional expressions. This oversight not only
        limits the scope of emotional recognition technology but also impacts its applicability in critical areas such
        as early diagnosis and educational settings, where understanding a child's emotional state is paramount.

<div class="section">
    <h2>Current Solutions and Their Limitations</h2>
    <p>Current solutions in emotional recognition technology heavily rely on datasets dominated by adult facial
        expressions. These models, when applied to children, encounter a significant drop in accuracy. They struggle to
        interpret the nuanced expressions of children, whose emotional manifestations can differ greatly from adults.
        The limitations are glaring: a lack of diverse training data leads to models that are ill-equipped for
        real-world conditions where lighting, occlusion, and varied expressions play a crucial role.
    </p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Proposed Solutions</h2>
    <p>Our project embarks on a journey to refine emotional recognition technology, specifically tailored for children.
        By expanding our training datasets to include a rich variety of both adult and children's faces, and
        incorporating data augmentation techniques such as low lighting adjustments, blurring, and occlusion, we aim to
        develop a model that thrives under real-world conditions. Employing transfer learning from various pre-trained
        models, we meticulously selected and tested six, eventually narrowing down to three that show promise. Our
        approach not only enhances the model's ability to generalize across different age groups but also lays the
        groundwork for future advancements in pre-diagnostic tools. These tools could vastly improve the accuracy of
        emotional assessments in children, leading to better support in educational and developmental contexts.
